# Unhandled Errors in TypeScript Array Combination

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: failing to handle potential null or undefined inputs when working with arrays. The `combine` function, as initially written, will throw an error if either input array is null or undefined. This README explains the problem and provides a robust solution.

## Problem

The original `combine` function directly uses `concat` without checking the input arrays for null or undefined values.  This leads to runtime errors if unexpected input is provided.

## Solution

The updated `combine` function incorporates null checks and type guards to prevent errors.  The solution utilizes optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle the potential absence of arrays gracefully.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
3. Compile and run the TypeScript files using a TypeScript compiler (tsc) and a Node.js runtime.
